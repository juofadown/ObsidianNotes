For an Output the Method: WriteLine() is used.

For each new WriteLine that is added, a new Line (Enter) will be added.

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
```
**Output:**

I can also output mathematical calculations:
```C#
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
```

There is another similar Method called Write(). Its the same as WriteLine but it doesnt add a new Line for each time its executed.

```C#
Console.Write("The Write() Method doesn't add a new Line (Enter) ");
Console.Write("It will print on the same line.");
```

**Output:**
