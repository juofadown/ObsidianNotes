# IDE
Tutorial how to get the IDE, I already had the IDE so skipped this part.
# First Program
I added a Console.WriteLine Command to the default code that is there if you create a new Project

```C#
namespace W3SchoolsProject
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

This Program opens the Terminal and displays the String I wrote in Console.WriteLine.
