The Code of the Exercise in Get Started is being explained.

I pretty much knew everything already. But I didn't know that if 
```C#
using System;
```
is omitted, then the WriteLine Command could be written like this:
```C#
System.Console.WriteLine("WAZZAAA, I HAVE NO TIME TO LEARN FOR THE TEST");
```
Notes from the Tutorial I think are good to know:

**Note:** Every C# statement ends with a semicolon `;`

**Note:** C# is case-sensitive; "MyClass" and "myclass" have different meaning.

**Note:** Unlike Java, the name of the C# file does not have to match the class name, but they often do (for better organization). When saving the file, save it using a proper name and add ".cs" to the end of the filename.
